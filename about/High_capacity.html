<p>These countries all have <b>established open data policies</b>, generally with <b>strong political backing</b>. They have extended a <b>culture of open data</b> out beyond a single government department with open data practices adopted in different government agencies, and increasingly at a local government level. These countries tend to adopt similar approaches to open data, incorporating key principles of the open definition, and <b>emphasising issues of open data licensing</b>. They have <b>government, civil society and private sector capacity</b> to benefit from open data.</p>
